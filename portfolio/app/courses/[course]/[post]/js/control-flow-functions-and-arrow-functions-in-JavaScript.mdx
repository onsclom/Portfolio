## Week 2: Control Flow, Functions, and Arrow Functions in JavaScript

In this post, we're diving into some core JavaScript concepts: Control Flow, Functions, and Arrow Functions. These are fundamental for any JavaScript developer, providing the tools needed to write efficient and effective code.

### Understanding Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow your program to make decisions and take different actions based on varying conditions.

#### If, Else If, Else Statements

For handling decisions based on conditions, the `if`, `else if`, `else` statements are indispensable. For instance, consider displaying messages based on a customer's order size in a coffee shop scenario:

```javascript
let orderAmount = 16;

if (orderAmount > 15) {
    console.log("Enjoy your free cookie!");
} else if (orderAmount > 10) {
    console.log("Enjoy your free coffee!");
} else {
    console.log("Thank you for your purchase!");
}
```

#### Switch Statements

When dealing with multiple conditions leading to different outcomes, `switch` statements offer a more structured approach:

```javascript
let coffeeSize = "large";

switch (coffeeSize) {
    case "small":
        console.log("That'll be $2");
        break;
    case "medium":
        console.log("That'll be $3");
        break;
    case "large":
        console.log("That'll be $4");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("We don't have that size");
}
```

### Loops for Repetition

Loops are a powerful feature that allows you to execute a block of code multiple times.

#### For Loop

The `for` loop is ideal when the number of iterations is known:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

#### While Loop

The `while` loop is suitable when the number of iterations is not predetermined:

```javascript
let coffeeLeft = 5;

while (coffeeLeft > 0) {
    console.log("Serving coffee...");
    coffeeLeft--;
}
```

#### Do-While Loop

The `do-while` loop ensures the code block is executed at least once:

```javascript
let doYouWantMoreCoffee = false;

do {
    console.log("Here's your extra coffee!");
} while (doYouWantMoreCoffee);
```

### Functions: Reusable Code Blocks

Functions allow you to encapsulate code for reuse, making your code more modular and manageable.

#### Function Declarations

Declare functions to perform specific tasks, like calculating the total price after tax:

```javascript
function calculateTotalPrice(amount, taxRate) {
    return amount + amount * taxRate;
}

console.log(calculateTotalPrice(100, 0.15)); // 115
```
