**Part 3: Class Inheritance and Method Overriding (25 minutes)**

-   **Concept Explanation:** Discussion on the principles of inheritance and method overriding in Python.
-   **Live Coding Example:**

    ```python
    class Animal:
        def speak(self):
            return "Some sound"

    class Dog(Animal):
        def speak(self):
            return "Woof!"

    generic_animal = Animal()
    fido = Dog()
    print(generic_animal.speak())  # Outputs: Some sound
    print(fido.speak())            # Outputs: Woof!
    ```

-   **Exercise:** Students create subclasses from a base class Animal, such as Cat, that overrides speak method to return "Meow" and adds a new method `purr()`.
