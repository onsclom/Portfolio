**Part 1: Decorators (25 minutes)**

-   **Concept Explanation:** Introduction to decorators as functions that modify the functionality of another function. Explanation of class-related decorators like @classmethod, @staticmethod, and @property.
-   **Live Coding Example:**

    ```python
    def my_decorator(func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
            result = func(*args, **kwargs)
            print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
            return result
        return wrapper

    @my_decorator
    def say_hello(name):
        print(f"Hello {name}")

    say_hello("Alice")
    ```

-   **Exercise:** Students write a decorator that logs every time a method is called in a class.
