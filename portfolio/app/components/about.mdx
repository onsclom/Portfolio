Hey! I’m a programmer through and through, but climbing is my second passion. I love the challenge and creativity of programming, especially solving problems that really make me think.

Currently, I’m part of the awesome team at [Pervasive Gaming](https://pervasivegaming.com/), where we use the .NET stack to create engaging cabinet games. Our toolkit? C# for the backend, keeping things running smoothly, and JavaScript to bring the frontend to life. I’m all about the frontend, and in just a year, we’ve rolled out 15 games for our clients.

Before this, I was diving into data as a Business Process Analyst with the [Department of Energy](https://nnss.gov/). There, I was all about using Python, Excel, and SQL to analyze data, working closely with both the business and IT teams to ensure our projects hit the mark.

Though JavaScript is my go-to, I still have a huge interest in Data Analysis. That's why I’ve been sharing my knowledge by tutoring JavaScript and Python at [Varsity Tutors](https://www.varsitytutors.com/). If you’re one of my students, hey there! Check out the [classes](/classes) tab for our notes.

Outside of coding, climbing and editing my climbing videos are where you’ll find me. Interested?

And, I love sharing music finds with my friends. For a glimpse into my music preferences, check out my profile on [RateMyMusic](https://rateyourmusic.com/~GNNR).
